      ne Sunday morning in 2007, I was out for a leisurely drive. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. As I found myself at the intersection of Royal York and The Queensway, a little voice in the back of my head said, drive south to the lake. I decided to listen.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Traveling south along Royal York Road, I was surprised to see that I had entered a quaint, cottage-like community. It was filled with adorable homes that retained a rustic charm, which was refreshing from the downtown condo trends.  After passing some churches, local shops and community centres, I noticed a bustling patch of sidewalk.  Curiosity got the better of me and I pulled over.  The commotion was all centred around an Italian sandwich shop. SANDREMO, the sign read. With my interest peaked, I decided to go in.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character sc">A</span>s I entered the shop, I was delightfully overwhelmed with what I can only describe as a carnivalistic extravaganza of Italian cuisine. My head danced with an array of sights and smells from the deliciously overloaded deli counter.  I ordered a coffee and cannoli and found a perch by the window.  While I sat there and sipped, I was mesmerized by the flurry of customers, with smiles ear to ear, bustling in and out of the delicatessen.
    <p class="margin-top-10">Once I had descended from my sugar high, I went back to my car and continued driving south along Royal York. It was not long before I rolled to a stop at the intersection of Lake Shore Boulevard. There, before me, was the deep-blue majesty of Lake Ontario.  It was only a stone’s throw away. Absolutely beautiful, I thought.  For a moment, I watched in awe.  Whether it was fate or the incessant honking of the angry driver behind me, I pulled a quick left and headed east on Lake Shore.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character sc">M</span>y jaw fell open as I saw the most incredible row of lake-side mansions and turn-of-the-century homes. Where am I, I wondered, and how have I never been here before? As I continued along Lake Shore, I let the scenery wash over me; the parks, the quaint businesses, the lakeside paths. When I arrived at Parklawn Road (at this time, still replete with vintage hotels) I just had to turn back. The neighbourhood felt like a dream and I didn’t want it to end.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">
      A cute, little coffee shop popped into my memory; BIRDS & BEANS. I had seen it a few blocks back. It seemed like an excellent destination for this day of discovery. I pulled up to the shop and popped inside. Bounding up to the counter (perhaps a little too enthusiastically) I abruptly asked, “Where are we?  What community is this?

    <p>“Ahhh… Mimico,” the startled barista replied.</p>
    <p>The following week, I bought a house here. Within two months, I was moved in and settled.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">This is a true story. Since then, I have lived in this community and sold many houses here. I’ve also had the honour of bringing many incredible people to the area.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">As of 2018, I have made the decision to start focusing the majority of my attention on Mimico. Although there are many capable agents working here, I feel that they are missing something unique about the neighbourhood. This has spurred my desire to create a specific Mimico brand, taking my downtown marketing, negotiation, and presentation skills and combining them with an authentic and welcoming approach that truly befits this lakeside community.</p>

        <p><strong>If you’re not doing what you love you’re doing it wrong.
        I’m lucky enough to be doing it right.</strong>
        As long as I can remember I’ve been fascinated about buildings and their structures – houses and interior design. I love the smell of fresh paint, see the beauty of exposed brick and still marvel at the character and craftsmanship of the victorian era. I love how every home tells a story, takes on a personality and I can see the potential of each one.</p>
        <p>In my 20s I began buying and renovating properties. Then I took it a step further and became a real estate broker. I knew immediately I had made the right choice. I was hooked and needed more so I founded Real Estate Love – my own independent brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>Early in my career, I had many opportunities to join a larger brokerage firm. It didn’t take too much soul-searching to realize it’s not my thing. Too big. Too many stakeholders. Too impersonal. Far too much BS.
I much prefer the personalized, bespoke service I can provide. Every one of my clients is unique – as is each home — so a templated, cookie-cutter approach to buying and selling homes just doesn’t work for me.
I can honestly say I have a heart and mind for real estate. A bit cliché, but it’s true. My passion for this industry motivates me and drives me every day while my practical and technical experience delivers successful results and happy clients.</p>
